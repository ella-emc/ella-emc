# 👋 Hi, I’m Ella C., an IT student.
<p align="center"> <strong> <em> in which STEM and Languages fill my life </em> </strong> </p>

I'm an IT student aspiring to become a web developer and, in the long run, a computational linguist. After half a lifetime of being immersed in language learning, I have
decided to broaden my knowledge by learning how to code. 
- 👀 I’m interested in **languages**, **linguistics**, and **programming**. (I have some other interests, but these take up most of my time and have become a huge part
of myself.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **front-end web development** and **Python**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source websites** about STEM in order to make them more accessible to eager and interested students, as well as on projects 
having to do with **language technologies**. I am still working on my coding and programming skills, though, and I still have a long way to go!
- ✍️ I also write blog articles about STEM and languages on my Medium account under [**Ella C.**](https://ella-emc.medium.com/) Your perusal would mean the world to me!

When I'm not busy learning people-speak (natural languages) and machine-speak (programming languages), you can find me reading, drawing, or eating.
